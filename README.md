# DH140: Coding for Humanities
## About me: 
**Hello! My name is Yamileth Medina but I like to go by Yamy for short. I am a first-gen student at UCLA, I am in my fourth year and I am Chicana/o and Central American Studies Major and a Digital Humaniies Minor.**

## Course Descirption: 
DH140 will be preparing students to learn Python through a humanities lens. Over this quarter, we will be developing our Python fluency and will be using Python to express our own stories through (but not limited to) identifying patterns in literature, recommending new music to your friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks


## Project Ideas: 
Through Python, my goal is to transfer my humanities based research onto an interactive webpage or possibly even through an educational and informative game. 

## Objectives: 
To be able to read mutiple coding launguages and to write code with ease.
